+ Intro

Miniyacc, generates LALR(1) tables for LR parsers.
It is trivial to port to a new language and has
a smooth implementation (no optimizations).

+ Space saving strategy

The compression scheme used to store the actions
is a single displacement table.  It is described
in the dragon book and in

  R. Tarjan and A. Yao, "Storing a Sparse Table"
  CACM Vol. 22 No. 11, 1979, pp. 606-611

Before applying this compression scheme, we
remove the most common reduce from every row
and store it in a "default" table.  Error
actions become the default reduce, it is a
well-known harmless optimization: the error
will be detected later when no shift is
possible.

+ Tables generated by miniyacc

  - yyr1    rule -> arity of rhs
  - yyr2    rule -> lhs symbol
  - yydef   state -> default reduce (-1 if none)
  - yyadsp  displacements for actions in yyact
  - yygdsp  displacements for gotos in yyact
  - yyact   state ⨉ tok -> action
            state ⨉ symbol -> state
  - yychk   validation table for yyact

A non-negative action is a shift action, the
value of the action is the destination state.
An action <= -2 is a reduce by the rule whose
number is the opposite of the action minus two.
A missing action in yyact is the default action.
This one is either -1, indicating an error state,
or a rule number to reduce.  A -1 in the action
table marks an explicit parsing error.

+ Notes

++ About reduces

Even though it is fairly obvious that in a
single state their can bit shifts towards
different states.  It is also true that,
depending on the lookahead, their can be
multiple reduces.  For an example, consider
the following grammar:

  S -> A c | B
  A -> c
  B -> c

While possible, this case happens extremely
rarely in practice, even on large languages.

++ About goto

It is impossible that a goto on two different
symbols yields to the same state, so if the
goto table is indexed by states first and then
non-terminal, there is no point in having a
default action.

The dragon book recommends to index the table
first by symbol, and then by state.  In this
case, a default goto is helpful.
